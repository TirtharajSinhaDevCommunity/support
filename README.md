### Some vague idea of how we could turn this into a support channel.

Imagine the scenario where you are helping a stranger (or a new friend), a friend or a colleague on Discord / MS Teams / Slack / YouTube, etc. They may have found an old article from 5+ years ago about Docker that is not supported, a Node.js article that isn't supported in Node v14 and that sort of thing...

You volunteer to help that person, you pair on it, it's fixed and they're super happy.

The unfortunate thing about this is it then lacks a write-up on what was used, what articles were used etc (which would be reference articles) - we could simply use a GitHub issue queue for this - so folks could Google for somebody with the same problem!

Unfortunately, StackOverflow has a bit of a broken reputation system where folks with the "worst accepted answer" can actually start to get privileges to do more things.

### Ideas

Get your ideas in the GitHub Issue Queue!

If we could find a really good name for this, we could have a `"support"` repo in GitHub profiles, similar to the GitHub username README (n.b. to create `githubusername/githubusername` as a repo then put a README in there.)

We could then have folks to have their own "support" repository and be able to PR in their contributions!

Please check out the [issue queue](https://github.com/TirtharajSinhaDevCommunity/support/issues) for sticking issues with this and we can all pair on this.
